QR Factorisation

Python program to find the QR factorization of an m × n matrix. 

The program takes in number of rows m and number of columns n as well as the entries of the matrix A, as inputs.
The output of the program is an m × n matrix Q and an n × n matrix R such that A = QR. Q should be a matrix which has the property
that QTQ = I and R should be triangular.
